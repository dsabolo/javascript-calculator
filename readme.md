# About

This was the final assignment of my freshman year. We had to build a calculator using Javascript without using eval.

I decided to separate all functionality by defining several classes. My application relies heavily on recent ES6 functions such as string literals, classes and arrow functions. Also I use local storage. 

This projects works in a recent version of the following browsers:

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Edge
* Safari
